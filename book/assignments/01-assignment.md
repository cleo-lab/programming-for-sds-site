# Assignment 1

There are two options for completing this assignment. Either follow the instructions [here](../course-info/getting-started.ipynb) to launch a **virtual JupyterLab  environment**. Or... install Python **locally** following [these instructions](../course-info/python.md).

*****************************
## Task 1 (5 points)

* Complete the background survey on Canvas.


*****************************
## Task 2 (5 points)

In your new Jupyter Notebook, write some **Python code** that returns the following:

* a) a variable named `willamette` that contains the length of the Willamette River (187 miles) in kilometers

* b) a variable named `mckenzie` that contains the length of the McKenzie River (145 km) in miles

* c) a variable named `combined` that contains the combined length of the Willamette and McKenzie rivers in kilometers

Note that we can convert from **miles** to **kilometers** by multiplying the length value by 1.609. 

*****************************
## Task 3 (5 points)

Write some **Python code** that prints the **data types** of the following variables:

```
a) city = 'Eugene'

b) distance = 10.5

c) coins = 3

d) beans = '3.0'

e) time = 14.32
```
*****************************
## Task 4 (5 points)

Here is a list of apple varieties:

```
apples = ['empire', 'fuji', 'pink lady', 'gala', 'golden delicious', 'granny smith', 'honeycrisp', 'mcintosh', 'red delicious', 'braeburn', 'holstein', 'cameo', 'lady alice', 'envy', 'pazazz', 'jazz', 'hidden rose', 'ambrosia', 'jonagold', 'gravenstein', 'liberty', 'winesap', 'mutsu', 'opal', 'pacific rose']
```

Copy and paste this list into your notebook and write some Python code to answer the following:

* a) How many items are in this list?

* b) Which is the seventh item in this list?

* c) Which is the last item in this list?

* d) After sorting alphabetically, which is fifth item in the list?

* e) After sorting reverse alphabetically, which is twelfth item in the list? 

*****************************
## Task 5 (5 points)

* Add a title, your name, and date of this submission to your Jupyter Notebook using **Markdown text**.

* Add some more **Markdown text** to separate each task of this assignment and use **f-strings** to make yours answers clear.


```{important} Save your notebook to your local course folder and submit assignment (in **.pdf** format) to Canvas by the deadline.
