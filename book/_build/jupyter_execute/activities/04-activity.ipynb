The data can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/7reqx12fh954vi2tjb5p7/golf-oregon.csv?rlkey=musbdorxqutxe2e4ck2aihko3&dl=0) and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x93b8cr6qmedvturck00u/or-zip-codes-data.csv?rlkey=7ffg3jma51rmnc1614vc3eacg&dl=0). The first dataset is a table of golf courses in Oregon. The second dataset is provides population data for each zip code in Oregon.  \n",
