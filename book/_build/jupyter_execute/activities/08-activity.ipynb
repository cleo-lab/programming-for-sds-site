    "In this activity, we will combine several vector datasets to investigate the spatial distribution of buildings in Eastern Oregon. The building footprints can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/e5fhrozgfv2bsj224w87r/eastern-oregon-buildings.geojson?rlkey=ci2ycqrm5y1ouhky578ye9h4m&st=9xy0bsho&dl=0). This a subset of buildings from the dataset produced by Microsoft using AI. See the [GitHub page](https://github.com/Microsoft/USBuildingFootprints) for more information about the data. The other datasets we will need is the highways dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/k7le95ttz1ekgq83muxej/highways.zip?rlkey=wu09bsduthq1mr323fauodg2r&st=kkorc7b2&dl=0) and the Census tracts dataset which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/mi4nh71pqaqtfv34nsg0t/tracts.zip?rlkey=q90fkkoekrto3o2wa1g1enbet&st=qgxjo890&dl=0). A \"tract\" is a subdivision used by the Census Bureau that is smaller than a county and usually contains between 1,200 and 8,000 people.\n",
