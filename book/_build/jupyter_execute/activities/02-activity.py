# *****************************
# 
# ## Task 1 (6 points)
# 
# Run the grid cells above to define the three grids. Answer the following questions as **f-strings**:
# 
# * a) How many rows and columnns are in `grid_a`?
# 
# * b) How many elements in `grid_a`?
# 
# * c) Which grid has the most numbers equal to 1?
# 
# * d) Print the data type of `grid_a`?
# 
# * e) Print the data type of the first element in `grid_a`? (i.e. [0,0]). What does `int8` mean?
# 
# * f) What is the largest number that can be stored as `int8`? Show your working.

# 
# ## Task 2 (12 points)
# 
# * a) What is the mean of the rook neighborhoods for element `[1,1]` in `grid_a`, `grid_b` and `grid_c`? (not including element `[1,1]`)
# 
# * b) Repeat **(a)** but for bishop neighborhoods.
# 
# * c) Repeat **(a)** but for queen neighborhoods.
# 
# Based on your answers to (a), (b), and (c):
# 
# * d) In which grid does the value of element `[1,1]` exhbit **positive** spatial autocorrelation?
# 
# * e) In which grid does the value of element `[1,1]` exhbit **negative** spatial autocorrelation?
# 
# *****************************
# 
# ## Task 3 (2 points)
# 
# * Add a title, your name, and date of this submission to your Jupyter Notebook using **Markdown text**.
# 
# * Add some more **Markdown text** to separate each task of this assignment and use **f-strings** to make yours answers clear.
# 
# ```{important} 
# Save your notebook to your local course folder and submit assignment (in **.pdf** format) to Canvas by the deadline.
