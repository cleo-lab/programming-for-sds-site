The data can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/4m16i3lkbvi9tyo3kpyxe/avg-precip-months-seasons.csv?rlkey=09r6ki4nr5vkrvc4yyzhadyk6&st=y4jg83yq&dl=0) and [here](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/8n2k7ux98a5uofi29n046/glaciers.csv?rlkey=f2eeam6rckhs96ni6s19tz9zb&st=phtclcvn&dl=0). The first dataset contains average monthly rainfall in inches. The second dataset contains the average loss of global glaciers from 1945 to the present from NOAA data."
