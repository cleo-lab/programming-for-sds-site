# # Getting started

# We will use several applications for programming and communications during this course. The main application we will use is [`JupyterLab`](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html) which is a **free**, web-based interactive development environment (IDE) for code development.

# ```{admonition} Task
# Launch JupyterLab by clicking this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/owel-lab/gds-applications-site/HEAD)
# ```

# It takes a minute to spin-up but eventually we will see a custom JupyterLab environment in which we can execute code and complete assignments.
# 
# 
# The JupyterLab interface consists of different components such as a file browser, terminal, console, text editor, etc. But the main component we will use during this course are **Jupyter Notebooks** (with `.ipynb` extension) which can contain computer code and rich text elements (headings, lists, figures, links, etc.). Jupyter Notebooks are great for sharing code between instructor and students. 
# 
# ```{admonition} Open a new notebook
# We can open a new notebook by clicking the **Python 3 (ipykernel)** panel under **notebook**.
