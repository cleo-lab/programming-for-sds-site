# Slack

We will use [Slack](https://slack.com/) for most discussion and questions.

## Access Slack workspace

We will send an invite link to all enrolled students via email (and Canvas).. Before you can start using Slack, you should create a new account (if you don’t have one already) and accept the invitation you have received.

After accepting the invitation, you can access the course Slack team via this link: http://xxx.slack.com

It is recommended that you use the standalone desktop app rather than the web interface. If you’re confused or uncertain about something in the lab, please ask or post a question/comment on the relevant Slack channel (e.g., #lab01).
