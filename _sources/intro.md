# Welcome to Programming for Spatial Data Science 2023!

On this website you will find the course materials developed for GEOG 2XX taught at the [Department of Geography, University of Oregon](https://geography.uoregon.edu/) in Fall 2023. 

## Overview

The goal of this course is to introduce students to basic programming concepts in Python and apply these skills to various geospatial problems. There are no pre-requisites and students do not need any previous programming experience. Each week we will have a short lecture that introduces a new topic. In the following assignment, students will apply these new concepts to solve common tasks involving geospatial data. During this course, students will become familiar with the main Python packages used for loading, processing, visualizing, and analyzing geospatial data. Students are encouraged to discuss and collaborate on the assignments. However, assignments must be completed and submitted individually. 

## Learning outcomes:

* Acquire basic Python coding skills

* Understand types of data representation (e.g. variables, strings, numbers).

* Implement common programming techniques (e.g. conditional statements, loops, functions).

* Become familiar with object-oriented programming

* Analyze table, vector, and raster data with appropriate Python libraries

* Visualize different types of data using appropriate plotting techniques

* Recognize the importance of open-source software

## Course philosophy

### Python 

Python has become the leading programming introduction course in Geography and Earth Science departments. Python is a high-level language that both command line and compiled requires less resources to run and uses available open source integrated development environments (IDE).  With a basic syntax it provides straight forward and modern programming features.  Python is used as the core development language for many platforms. Python is a versatile programming language, suitable for projects ranging from small scripts to large systems. 

### Open-source
