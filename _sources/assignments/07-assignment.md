# Assignment 7

If you are using the virtual environment, launch JupyterLab by clicking this button: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/owel-lab/programming-for-sds-site/HEAD)

If you have installed Python locally, launch JupyterLab by running:

```
conda activate sds
```
and
```
jupyter lab
```

```{attention}
Print all answers (except Task 2 and 5) in a human-readable way using **f-string** formatting.
```

## Task 1 (5 points)

Download the data for the assignment [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/wk0a3i9mrk9c921/electric_generation_pnw.csv?dl=0). This dataset contains hourly sources of electricity generated in the Pacific Northwest (in MWh) between May 16, 2022 to June 14, 2022. If you are interested, the data were downloaded from [here](https://www.eia.gov/electricity/gridmonitor/dashboard/electric_overview/US48/US48). 

Read the data using `Pandas`, setting the `datetime` column as the **index**. Answer the following questions:

* a) How many rows and columnns are in this table?

* b) What are the column names?

* c) Which sources generate the most/least electricity **on average** during this time period?

*****************************

## Task 2 (5 points)

Make a visually-appealing plot showing the sources of electricity generated by wind, solar, hydro, natural gas, and coal.

*****************************

## Task 3 (5 points)

On which **day** was highest/lowest amount electricity generated for **each source**?

```{admonition} Click to reveal hint
:class: tip, dropdown
Consider using `resample()`.
```

*****************************

## Task 4 (5 points)

Make a new column called `hour` that contains the hour of the day as an **integer** for each row.

```{admonition} Click to reveal hint
:class: tip, dropdown
`Pandas` has some useful functions for this - [`df.index.hour`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.hour.html)
```

* a) On which **hour of the day** is most/least electricity generated by **solar**? Use the highest/lowest 15 values to compute the mean.

* b) On which **hour of the day** is most/least electricity generated by **natural gas**? Use the highest/lowest 15 values to compute the mean.

```{admonition} Click to reveal hint
:class: tip, dropdown
Consider using the `grouby()` function to group by hour (see demo on Week 4) and `nlargest()` or `nsmallest()` to retrieve the values.
```

*****************************

## Task 5 (5 points)

* a) Compute the **weekly average** electricity generated by wind, solar, hydro, natural gas, and coal using a **rolling window**.

* b) Make a visually-appealing plot to show this new data. 

* b) With reference to this plot, hypothesize which sources of electricity are likely to up/down/stay the same between June 14 and June 21, 2022.

*****************************

## Task 6 (5 points)

For each source, which **day of the week** (i.e. Mon, Tue, Wed) was most/least electricity generated? Please print out a day of the week instead of an integer.

```{admonition} Click to reveal hint
:class: tip, dropdown
Again, `Pandas` has some useful functions for this - [`df.index.dayofweek`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DatetimeIndex.dayofweek.html)
```

```{important} 
Save your notebook to your local course folder and submit assignment (in **.pdf** format) to Canvas by the deadline.
